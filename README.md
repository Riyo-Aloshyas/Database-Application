# Database-Application

Problem Description:

There is an XYZ Company, which purchases some parts from vendors to produce some
products. It has several departments, marketing sites, and parts supply vendors in the
company. Create a database management system based on given requirements.

Project Questions:

Can you think 5 more rules (other than the one explicitly described in thr requirements) 
that are likely to be used in a company?

1) Employee must be assigned to ONE department but can work in multiple departments.
2) Information regarding part (id, name, price, quantity) would be in PART_PURCHASE.
3) Aside from purchase id, part id would also be used.
4) Middle name or middle name initial would be used in any person/identity entity.
5) Employe has only 1 direct supervisor; however, a supervisor would have a multi-value num of supervisors.

Is the ability to model super-class/subclass relationships likely to be important in such
environment? Why or why not?

The ability to model superclass/subclass relationships would be important for this database 
environment because of the existence of multiple entities within an entity.
